## Project Overview
An interactive web mapping application developed for Avon Needs Trees' Landscape Recovery Project in the Lower Chew Valley, North Somerset. This project is part of DEFRA's Landscape Recovery scheme, supporting the transformation of the UK's largest new woodland creation in the South West.

The application visualizes:
- Land cover classification using remote sensing data
- Ecosystem services assessment
- Carbon storage potential
- Biodiversity metrics
- Natural flood management indicators
- Future landscape scenarios

## Key Features
- Interactive mapping interface using Leaflet.js
- Multiple data layers showing different environmental metrics
- Time series visualization of landscape change
- Mobile-responsive design
- User-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Mapping:**
  - Leaflet.js
  - ESRI basemaps
- **Data Processing:**
  - GeoJSON for spatial data
  - Remote sensing data integration
  - Machine learning classification outputs

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/ant-landscape-recovery.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd ant-landscape-recovery

3. Open index.html in a web browser or use a local server:
